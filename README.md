This is my effort to understand and implement the fundamental concept of neural networks without using any specific framework(like tensorflow, keras )
because i'd like to undertsand what happens under the hood first before "cheating" my way using keras.

In order to learn these concepts,I like many,relied on Andrew NG and his deep learning specialisation, and the above files are the specialisations' assignment.

So, here i start with learning the fundamentals of logistic regression, learn gradient decent, bias and weights. 
then i explore the different kinds of activation funtion, followed by implementing one layered NN.
after that we go to impelemting 2 layers 
and then implementing a N layered network
.
After that we explore hyperparameter tuning an how to make our NN better, bias-variance trade off and L-2 regularisation, drop out and Adam(which is widely used and considered the best,(ooh the math is cool for this one))

Learning these gave me an indepth understanding of how NNs work and its so fascinating and it wouldnt be so far fetched if i called it magic(even though i know the math now)
## So what next?
1. Presently learning the math of convolutional neural networks 
2. Since these assignments are just for the purpose of understanding, the assignments are at a very novice level.I will be continuing down the Neural network rabbit hole through keras from now on, focussing more on the application. My work on that can be followed on github.com/maruyari/tensorflow
